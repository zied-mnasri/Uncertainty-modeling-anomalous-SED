# Uncertainty-modeling-anomalous-SED
This method is about modeling uncertainty for anomalous sound event detection, inclding the use of type-2 Interval-Valued Fuzzy Sets (IVFS) to represent uncertainty, both on input (VAE's error) and on output (membership function).

The VAE model is trained on data extracted from MIVIA database "Pasquale Foggia, Nicolai Petkov, Alessia Saggese, Nicola Strisciuglio, and Mario Vento, “Audio surveillance of roads: A system for detecting anomalous sounds,” IEEE transactions on intelligent transportation systems, vol. 17, no. 1, pp. 279–288, 2015."
